<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Hi guys, my name's Bryan otherwise known in-game as Obtains (MY NEW NAME IS 'Elite'). This was my absolute first guide I've ever created and will most likely be the only one I will ever create again. I've played Akali ever since I about started League of Legends, and I've loved her ever since. The way she plays, her mechanics, the damage she deals, it's all flawless to me. Although I should forewarn you, Akali is a situational champion. If there is a lot of crowd control on the enemy team you should think again about choosing Akali. Her main role is to destroy the carries, picking them off before anything important happens. I'm not saying I have the best knowledge on Akali, but I would like to share with you guys what I do know. I hereby introduce you guys my take on Akali, Enjoy.<br />

<br /><h3 id="proscons">Pros / Cons</h3>
<table>
<tr><td class="left">
<li>Has an insane amount of burst damage.</li>
<li>Can escape easily with Twilight Shroud & Shadow Dance.</li>
<li>Covers vasts amount of distance with her sheer mobility.</li>
<li>Attack animations allow you to farm easily.</li>
<li>Extremely versatile.</li>
<li>Snowballs if doing well.</li>

<td class="left">
<li>Higher learning curve.</li>
<li>Practically no crowd control.</li>
<li>Crowd control rapes Akali.</li>
<li>Undoubtedly squishy.</li>
<li>One of the first targets people search for.</li>
<li>Items such as Vision Wards & Oracle's Elixir cripple her.</li>

</table><br />
RED:<br />Since Akali had recently had a passive change these marks are actually better for her, you only lose out on 2 magic penetration in return for 8 armor penetration. Remember that Akali is considered a hybrid champion, so these are the best choice.<br />
YELLOW:<br />For me personally, I've always favored HP/LVL seals. Since Akali can go middle the extra health keeps you safe against high burst champions that normally go middle, and can also be helpful top on ocassion.<br />
BLUE:<br />These are better than flat ability power gyphs, since you are concentrating on scaling into late game these AP/LVL glyphs will help you do more damage at the later stages of the game and help you become a greater threat once you reach level 6/7.<br />
BROWN:<br />The best quintessences you can get on a ability power based champion. More damage, more money, no problems. ;)<br /><br />

</table>
RED 1: Since Akali is played mainly ability power, these are also a solid choice. You can use these if you don't have Greater Mark of Hybrid Penetration. It's also a good idea to use these if you are laning against a bad early game champion.<br />
RED 2: Use these if you are laning against a high burst ability power champion. These help decrease the burst output they use on you to lane easier.<br /><br />

<tr><td>9x Armor</td><td>9x Magic<br />Resist</td><td>9x Health</td></tr>
</table>
YELLOW 1: Use these seals against AD champions that go mid or top. (ie. Talon)<br />
YELLOW 2: You could use these if you're going against a high burst ability power mid, but you are better off going MR glyphs/marks and sticking with Greater Seal of Scaling Health.<br />
YELLOW 3: These are good for early game, but fall off compared to Greater Seal of Scaling Health.<br /><br />

</table>
BLUE 1: Good for early game. Use against champions that have terrible early laning phases or if you want to take down your enemy as quickly as possible.<br />
BLUE 2: High burst champions like LeBlanc/ Brand? It's be wise to get these.<br />
BLUE 3: Get these if you're going against AP champions that scale into late game.<br /><br />

BROWN 1: These can be used for late game, combined with other items with magic penetration (ie.  Void Staff) to deal significant damage.<br />
BROWN 2: Use these against skill shot champions to be able to dodge their abilities easier. Also, helps ganking lanes quicker.<br />
BROWN 3: More health early game to withstand high burst AP champions, or annoying champions like Darius.<br />

<img src="../../img/spells/ignite.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">IGNITE</span><br />
Ignite is a summoner spell which I prefer, knowing my luck the majority of time my opponent escapes with barely any life left. Well Ignite solves that problem for me, dealing true damage over time it finishes off the opponent for me.<br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span><br />Used to gain distance between enemies. Flash + Shadow Dance[R] = Godly Range! You can also use Flash to escape any gank or team fight if it isn't favorable to you. Flashing through walls can save your life or can enable you to kill an enemy.<br />

<br />
ALTERNATIVES<br />

<img src="../../img/spells/teleport.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/cleanse.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">EXHAUST</span><br />
Can be used to slow the enemy down for that needed area to be able to Shadow Dance[R] onto the champion. Also decreases damage dealt to you and can be used to escape. Get this summoner if they have a lot of AD on their team.<br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
Allows you to gain movement speed to chase or escape from an enemy champion effectively. Able to run through those pesky minions that get in your way! Although, Flash is still a better choice.<br />
<span class="spell">TELEPORT</span><br />
This spell is very useful to protect your turret(s) or even an ally(s) when needed, blinking in by teleporting to a minion or ward in the middle of a team fight can change the tide of a game. <br />
<span class="spell">CLEANSE</span><br />
Use this summoner if the enemy team has a lot of crowd control.<br />

Boots of Speed and 3  Health Potions gives  Akali the mobility to move in lane efficiently. The  Boots of Speed allow you to get last hit better, harass the opponent with  Mark of the Assassin, and if you have a skill-shot oriented enemy helps you dodge the skill-shots much easier, while the 3  Health Potions give you a good amount of lane sustain, popping one each time you get to about 60~75% health. Lately, I've been waiting for the 4th  Health Potion as it comes in handy.</tr>

<h5>Mid game</h5>
<table>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/hextech-gunblade.png"></td><td class="left">An amazing item for a hybrid like  Akali. Branching from  Hextech Revolver bought early on, this is basically that but 45 attack damage which goes into your  Twin Disciplines and  Crescent Slash, 65 ability power providing to your magical damage and  Twin Disciplines, 10 life steal & 20 spell vamp synergizing with  Twin Disciplines! The main reason why this is bought is for the spell vamp boost, and active passive. With the active, it acts like another mini- Ignite, that with a range of 700 you can place on a target champion and also slow them too, it was basically made for Akali.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/rabadons-deathcap.png"></td><td class="left">With the highest ability power stats in the game, this item is wanted by every champion that scales with ability power.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/mercurys-treads.png"></td><td class="left">Buy these boots if the enemy team has a lot of crowd control, the tenacity reduces the time you are snared, stunned, etc.</td></tr>

<h5>End game</h5>
<table>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/void-staff.png"></td><td class="left">This item if a must have if you are facing an enemy team that is stacking magic resist against you. With the 35% magic penetration it can increase the amount damage you place onto the selected enemy champion. With the recent changes taking priority of getting this item over  Rabadon's Deathcap will actually deal more damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/lich-bane.png"></td><td class="left">One of the main reasons why this item is chosen is because of the passive along with the 80 ability power, and 5 movement speed. After using an ability your next auto attack will deal physical bonus damage refreshing every two seconds. Scaling with ability power this item gives even more burst to your  Mark of the Assassin than you had before. The key is to time your combo right so you get both procs on  Lich Bane activated when using  Mark of the Assassin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/deathfire-grasp.png"></td><td class="left">Get this item if they have one major threat. With the active passive you can burst down the enemy quickly. leaving the enemy team with no real damage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/mejais-soulstealer.png"></td><td class="left">If you are doing really well in the game, and not dying. I highly encourage you to buy this item, with 20 stacks and a  Rabadon's Deathcap you'll be taking an enemy champion down before anyone can react.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/liandrys-torment.png"></td><td class="left">Having been countered and having a hard time laning? Get this item to increase your health and help your early game out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/zhonyas-hourglass.png"></td><td class="left">This item is incredibly good now. Buying this as your second or third item allows you to be more reckless with  Akali and engage first. Very useful and allows you to be less reliant on your allies to play right.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/abyssal-scepter.png"></td><td class="left">Buy this item if the enemies have less than 80 magic resist, and not much AP damage on the other team</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/rylais-crystal-scepter.png"></td><td class="left">Buy this item if you're getting kited by champions like  Ashe, this also provides you with a decent amount of survivability and gives you a slow when you use a spell like  Mark of the Assassin.</td></tr>

<h5>Note</h5>
Different teams call for different items, you do not use this build for every game! There are items depending on the team you are up against such as magic resist items, etc.which will greatly attribute to you and your team.<br />

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game</h3>
I have received some feedback stating that players are having trouble with Akali in the early game laning phase, so I have added this section to further explain it.<br /><br />
Akali is the most difficult to play at level 1-5 because she lacks strong long range harass without Shadow Dance to close the distance. It is extremely easy to feed with her, like all squishy melee champs, and these levels are critical to setting the platform for the rest of the game, so it is important to play smart.<br /><br />
She is best in a solo lane versus a carry.  She can farm up on creep, and possibly get a kill or two on their carry. She needs to have a strong laning phase, and carry hard early game through mid game. She just cannot carry and survive late end game, simply because she's melee and focused too much. Eventually they will get smart and buy an Oracle's, or 3... Your job at that point is primarily to take out low health champs, and sometimes kamikaze against their carry so they lose their DPS. You will die more often end game... and your wonderful "carry" k/d ratio will plummet.<br />

<br /><h3 id="mid">Mid game</h3>
Akali cannot sustain full map lane pushes if she uses Crescent Slash a lot. It will eat her energy extremely quickly, and it is energy that she needs to defend herself or to dash into combat. Her best ability to farm long term is Mark of the Assassin, and limit Crescent Slash to once/twice per single wave.<br /><br />
When she encounters a very large creep wave, Crescent Slash can obliterate them very quickly. This skill does the best spread of damage on the wave when the wave is mobile. Once the ranged creep fan out across the lane it will not hit them all. Sometimes it is best to wait for the wave to push through your creep and become mobile again. Once they group up, Shadow Dance to the creep at the center and immediately spam Crescent Slash.<br />

<br /><h3 id="late">Late game</h3>
She does very well in the jungle, so be sure to take out the jungle creep while roaming (obviously if there is no jungle). It leaves more gold and exp to those laning, and overall more gold and exp for the team. But obviously, don't spend all of your time in the jungle, Akali is an assassin, so go do some assassinating and take out unsuspecting champs in lanes. Spending some time in the jungle after the laning phase intimidates all lanes while you're MIA.<br /><br />
In a group fight with Akali, knowing when to jump in is the most important decision. She should never ever initiate the group fight as she will die in a split second against a prepared group. It's a completely different story if they are unprepared...<br /><br />
Once the group fight starts and you see a decent amount of sparks fly (specifically targetable stuns/silences), immediately [item_text=Shadow Dance] to the squishiest highest DPS champ and take them out with your high burst damage. With her burst DPS it will only take a few seconds. If the team is good, most of them will quickly turn their spells to you and you will see your HP start to fall, but since you waited, most of their spells are on CD and their DPS will be lower, so immediately drop Twilight Shroud and do nothing. This is very important because you will stealth in combat and it will temporarily confuse them. They will blindly throw in skill shots, and waste AoE's, hopefully saving your team from most of that damage.<br /><br />
This confusion is critical to Akali in a team fight. With her speed and intimidating burst damage, enemies will want to hold their skills to use on you, yet the longer they hold them, the less DPS and CC they are doing to the rest of your team. In a short moment, the confusion will quickly turn to panic, and their team cohesion will weaken. They will be less likely to focus on one target, and will spread the damage more evenly across your team.<br /><br />
Again hold your actions until you see a few sparks fly, then burst damage down the next highest DPS squishiest champ. If their team is good, you will likely not survive the next wave of damage, however you alone took out a large chunk of their DPS. My Akali is frequently the only casualty on our side of a 5v5 group fight, with a total wipe on their side. Absolutely worth the death in my opinion.<br /><br />
If you are utilizing this tactic effectively, very often your opponents will buy an oracle potion or a vision ward! Pay attention to this counter tactic, because unfortunately, it works very well...<br />

To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Akali again :-)<br /><br />
<li>When using  Twilight Shroud make sure to walk on the edges of the bubble, if the champions decide to blindly use their abilities on you, they usually aim for the middle.</li>
<li>You can use  Twilight Shroud to check bushes safely, so you don't face-check.</li>
<li>When looking at the amount of energy you have, determine whether it is needed to use Twilight Shroud at all.</li>
<li>Twilight Shroud has an innate slow, so using that effectively can slow down opponents enough to catch up to them, or even slow them down to help your team-mates and yourself get at a safe distance from the enemy.</li>
<li>When you use your first  Mark of the Assassin in the  Twilight Shroud make sure to wait it out in the bubble until your  Mark of the Assassin comes off cool-down. This decreases the amount of damage inflicted upon yourself.</li><br />
If you enjoy playing mind games, instilling fear and confusion, and like playing glass cannon champs, Akali is for you. Akali is an amazing burst damage champ, however she is very squishy so you need to be careful. Speed and deception are your allies, so make good use of Shadow Dance, things like Flash, and in-combat stealth. Always underestimate her survivability, else she will drop like a rock if you don't take care of her. Respect her, love her, and she will put a smile on your face and at times a cackle in your laugh as you tear through enemy champs.<br />
