<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Amumu is not the hardest champion in the game to play, nor is he the easiest. He revolves around timing and position. Using his ultimate Curse of the Sad Mummy can turn the tide of a teamfight if used correctly. Additionally, it will take time for you to become used to throwing his Bandage Toss in order to be accurate with it. Despite this, Amumu is an incredibly rewarding champion that fits a wide variety of team compositions.<br />

RED:<br />These are useful for dealing higher damage all throughout the game, bypassing some magic resist of champs. 8.5 magic penetration is very useful when combined with Cursed Touch.<br />
YELLOW:<br />These runes are absolutely necessary in order to jungle with Amumu. If you don't have them, there is a high likelihood you will die.<br />
BLUE:<br />Because extra magic resist is always useful on a tank, and the jungle monsters don't deal magic damage, so scaling runes are the way to go here for a better late game.<br />
BROWN:<br />Amumu’s base movement speed is rather slow, which really hampers both his ganks and his jungle clear. These can be used by themselves or in combination with Greater Quintessence of Armors in order to speed you up. These are the optimal rune in this spot due to the superior ganking ability, mobility, and clear time you get with them.<br /><br />

<br /><h3 id="spells">Summoner's spells</h3>
<img src="../../img/spells/smite.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">SMITE + FLASH</span><br />These are the primary summoner spells that I use nearly every game. Rarely will you want to deviate from this setup for jungling Amumu. Smite is absolutely necessary for Amumu in order to clear camps more quickly, and secures camps from theft if timed correctly. Flash is the single most useful summoner spell in the game in my opinion, particularly with Amumu. Flash+ Curse of the Sad Mummy ultimates are extremely disruptive and can destroy an entire team if they are not prepared for it. Beyond that, Flash can be used to chase, escape, dodge, etc.<br />

<br />
ALTERNATIVES<br />
All the alternative summoner spells are to go in place of Flash. In no case should you ever remove Smite if you plan to jungle Amumu. It greatly increases the time it will take you to clear the jungle and leaves you without a way to secure buffs, dragon, and Baron. Personally, I wouldn’t remove Flash either, but it’s more flexible than Smite.<br />
<img src="../../img/spells/ghost.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/exhaust.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
The choice between Flash and Ghost is one all players make, and is mainly based on personal preference. The fact that Ghost ignores unit collision allows you to land that one last Bandage Toss without minions blocking your way to assure that kill. It also serves as an effective escape if necessary, which is why it can work well in place of Flash.<br />
<span class="spell">EXHAUST</span><br />
While Exhaust can also serve as an escape mechanism, it is only semi-reliable. If Lee Sin finds you in his jungle, he can simply Sonic Wave / Resonating Strike to you and Tempest / Cripple to keep you in place while the Exhaust wears off. At this point, you will have no way to get away besides running for it, since Amumu has no innate means of escape. Generally, I’ll take this summoner spell if I’m playing a very mobile champion, such as Shyvana who doesn’t need Flash or Ghost to escape from most situations. Despite it not being as safe as your other options, it can still aid in your ganks by holding down the target even longer after your Bandage Toss.<br />

<br /><h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<table>
<tr><td><img src="amumu-cursed-touch.png" /></td><td>Cursed Touch</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Amumu's autoattacks reduce the target's magic resistance by 15 / 20 / 25 for 3 seconds. This debuff refreshes with every autoattack.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">A great passive, lowering champions' magic resists by a full 25 points at level 18. This debuff is only applied when you basic attack an enemy champion, so it's important to do this often, even in a teamfight. This ability synergizes well with magic-damage heavy teams, boosting all of their damage when you're attacking the enemy as well. It also increases Amumu's overall damage, since all of his abilities inflict magic damage. It's important to note that this ability stacks with Sorcerer's Shoes, Liandry's Torment, and Abyssal Scepter, eliminating large portions of your enemies' magic resist.<br /><br />
<h5>Note:</h5>
- You HAVE to basic attack the target to apply the debuff. Your abilities will not apply it.<br />
- Cursed Touch doesn't stack with itself like items such as the The Black Cleaver. Alternating targets with auto-attacks would give each the full debuff. Just keep in mind your positioning and whether or not it would be beneficial for you to be moving around the fight to basic attack multiple targets or not. </td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="amumu-bandage-toss.png" /></td><td>Bandage Toss<br />Cooldown: 16/14/12/10/8<br />Cost: 80/90/100//110/120<br />Range: 1100</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Amumu tosses a sticky bandage in a straight line towards a target location. Amumu will pull himself to the enemy it contacts, dealing magic damage and stunning the target for 1 second.<br /><br />
Magic Damage: 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+ 70% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">This ability is a long-range, skill-shot stun that pulls you to the target when hit. Like the rest of Amumu's skills, it does Magic Damage and scales off of ability power. If you are used to champions that have fast skills shots like Ezreal, then aiming Bandage Toss will take time for you to become accustomed to.<br /><br />
It's important to note how far this ability travels, because there are very few champions that can claim to stun at a farther distance. (The only three champions who can claim such a feat are Ashe with her Enchanted Crystal Arrow, Xerath, and Sejuani) Use this range to catch your enemy unawares since you won't have to alert them beforehand of your location when you commit to a gank.<br /><br />
There are many uses to this ability, such as initiation, chasing, ganking, and escaping (extremely rare and situational). Despite these several uses, its usefulness for jungling is limited, which is why there are no skill points put into it until level 4. There are rare situations where it would be ideal to take Bandage Toss at level 3, which will be discussed later.<br /><br />
<h5>Note:</h5>
- Bandage Toss travels fairly slowly when compared to most skillshots. Consider placing the ability slightly in front of the opponent's path to compensate.<br />
- When you're ganking an enemy, it is not always optimal to use Bandage Toss right away. In order to avoid an enemy juking it, you could chase them and place yourself at an angle that makes it far more difficult to juke before using it. Remember, most Amumu ganks fail if they miss Bandage Toss.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="amumu-despair.png" /></td><td>Despair<br />Cooldown: 1<br />Cost: 8 mana/sec<br />Range: 400</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">TOGGLE: While toggled on, Amumu is surrounded by a small pool of damaging tears. Enemies in the area take magic damage each second equal to a base amount plus a percentage of their maximum health.<br /><br />
Base Magic Damage Per Second: 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24<br />
Additional Damage Per Second: 1.5 / 1.8 / 2.1 / 2.4 / 2.7% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of enemies' maximum health.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">This is the ability that makes jungle Amumu viable. It is a DoT AoE ability that does both flat damage combined with % of maximum health. (Keep in mind that both forms of damage are reduced from magic resist) While Amumu is slow to kill a single neutral monster, he makes up for it because he can clear several simultaneously. Outside of the jungle, the ability excels at providing sustained damage in a team fight and constantly draining enemy champions' health. The % of maximum health damage is what allows Amumu to drain the health of bulkier champions. This makes Amumu a great counterpick to Cho'Gath, Dr. Mundo, and Vladimir, all of whom are known for their tendency to stack health either through their abilities or due to synergy with the stat.<br /><br />
<h5>Note:</h5>
- If you begin running out of mana, use this as your primary damage. It has the highest damage/mana cost ratio of all Amumu's skills. </td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="amumu-tantrum.png" /></td><td>Tantrum<br />Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6<br />Cost: 35<br />Range: 200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">PASSIVE: Amumu takes reduced physical damage from autoattacks and abilities.<br />
ACTIVE: Amumu releases his anger, dealing magic damage to surrounding enemies. Each autoattack that hits Amumu will reduce the cooldown on Tantrum's active by 0.5 seconds<br /><br />
Physical Damage Reduction: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10<br />
Magic Damage: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 / 175 (+ 50% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Your primary farming skill and main source of burst damage. Like Despair, Tantrum is also AoE and has a relatively low mana cost. However, it can still drain your mana relatively quickly and leave you OoM if you spam it. In the jungle, it benefits you by providing passive physical damage reduction from physical attacks. Not only that, but its cooldown is lowered by half a second whenever you're hit by an auto-attack.<br /><br />
<h5>Note:</h5>
- The actual range of Tantrum is larger than the animation associated with the ability would make it appear. Familiarize yourself with the range by hovering your mouse cursor over the icon in-game.<br />
- Due to the passive damage reduction Tantrum provides, and the reduction in cooldown it gets from received basic attacks, taking aggro from minions mid to late game will deal almost no damage to you while constantly lowering its cooldown.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="amumu-curse-of-the-sad-mummy.png" /></td><td>Curse of the Sad Mummy<br />Cooldown: 150/130/110<br />Cost: 100/150/200<br />Range: 550</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Amumu entangles surrounding enemy units, dealing magic damage and rendering them unable to move and attack for 2 seconds. <br /><br />Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 80% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Like the ultimates of most characters, this is the spell that defines Amumu. This skill alone is why you see him banned often in ranked games. Upon activation, all champions in the surrounding area instantly have damage and a snare applied. With the amount of AP included in this build, anyone who hasn't built magic resist will take a lot of damage. The insane power and utility of this ultimate is only counteracted by its high cooldown. Therefore, you'll want to make effective use of it so as not to waste it and be without it at a crucial moment. I'll include a section describing these situations later in the guide.<br /><br />
<h5>Note:</h5>
- Curse of the Sad Mummy is an entangle, not a stun. This means it won't stop channeling abilities such as Katarina's Death Lotus or Nunu's Absolute Zero. In order to stop these channels, you will need to hit them with Bandage Toss.<br />
- Curse of the Sad Mummy is primarily useful for the utility of locking down enemy champions, not for the damage. As such, be careful not to waste it on champions who have an ability that allows them to escape it. These champions are: Alistar with Unbreakable Will, Gangplank with Remove Scurvy, or Olaf with Ragnarok. Additionally, Vladimir in Sanguine Pool and Fizz using Playful / Trickster will both dodge the ability completely.<br />
- This ability serves to counter heavy AD teams or teams compositions focusing on auto-attacks by preventing basic attacks completely from all entangled targets.</td></tr>

<h5>Note</h5>
There are many viable ways to build Amumu and be successful. However, in this guide I try to focus on filling the role of a tank capable of both great sustained damage and utility, rather than trying to be a support-tank like Maokai. The reason being for this is that Amumu's unique skill set encourages the player to stand in the middle of the enemy team, rather than his own team like a traditional support. Therefore, you will often be out of range to provide buffs to key members, particularly if they have long ranges.<br />

<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/sunfire-cape.png"></td><td class="left">One of the more powerful items in the current metagame, mostly due to the predominance of AD Casters, Sunfire Cape gives a sizable amount of both armor and health in order to counter these threats, while at the same time giving you a fair amount of damage from its active that synergizes with Despair.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/sorcerers-shoes.png"></td><td class="left">Because the majority of Amumu's damage is magic rather than physical, these can greatly aid you in getting by champions who build larger amount of magic resist that lessens your damage. In addition, Amumu's high base damages of his abilities make magic penetration an extremely cost efficient way to increase him damage, similar to why Abyssal Scepter synergizes with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/locket-of-the-iron-solari.png"></td><td class="left">Locket of the Iron Solari is likely one of the most cost-efficient items in the game right now. For only 2000 total gold, you're getting a sizable amount of health, armor, cooldown reduction, and a little bit of health regen. Additionally, being able to shield your teammates can give you a huge advantage in teamfights, especially considering how effective of a tanking stat health has become in the current metagame. Overall, this item is extremely important to have on every team, and is extremely strong on Amumu for the stats it gives.</td></tr>

<h5>End game</h5>
<table>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/spirit-of-the-ancient-golem.png"></td><td class="left">While at the beginning of the season I did not like the “Spirit” item series, the decrease in the price of Spirit Stone in addition to the buffs some of them has received as given me a new outlook on them. In a metagame where health dominates, it is fairly efficient that this item builds out of a Giant's Belt. The armor is also great for tanking, while the tenacity is useful for some CC reduction to prevent excessive kiting by the enemy. At the same time, this item will make you a strong pusher due to the passive damage increase on minions and monsters.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/abyssal-scepter.png"></td><td class="left">Abyssal Scepter has always been a core item on Amumu since I first created this guide, and it continues to be now in season 3. Despite receiving various nerfs, it still compliments Amumu’s kit perfectly, enhancing his team’s damage in addition to his own thanks to the magic resist debuff it offers, which is the single best way to amplify Amumu’s own damage since the nerfs to his AP ratios. Additionally, it is fairly cheap, which is an important aspect of junglers’ builds in season 3, since GP10 items are far less effective in the new jungle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/frozen-heart.png"></td><td class="left">Another one of the items I have continued to build on Amumu through the season shift, Frozen Heart synergizes with Amumu very well, and can really be a powerful, game changing item if bought at the right time. The armor and cooldown reduction both compliment Amumu’s needs as champions transition into late game, since AD carries hit their strong point as they finish item builds. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to tank them yourself while debuffing them with Frozen Heart’s aura. When building this item, determine whether you want the cooldown reduction of Glacial Shroud or the debuff of Warden's Mail first, keeping in mind the limitations of the Warden's Mail passive. The component you build first is important to your success in later teamfights, where losing just one can mean the game. </td></tr>

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game (Jungling)</h3>
So obviously the reason you took the time to read the sections before this (or skim) is so that you would be able to jungle effectively with Amumu. Know ahead of time that it does take time to get used to jungling with him, especially if you're used to popular melee junglers such as Lee Sin and Shaco, but the team utility he provides along with excellent ganks definitely make him just as valuable on that team slot as the before mentioned champions, perhaps even more so.<br /><br />
Also, I've decided to alter this section so that it details the optimal, fastest way to jungle rather than the beginner friendly way. Know ahead of time that while this method is faster than starting immediately at the blue buff, it is by no means necessary to do this. If you're new to jungling or Amumu feel free to use the older route, beginning at blue buff rather than wolves.<br /><br />
When the game begins, you will want to buy Hunter's Machete and five Health Potions. These will speed up your early jungle, and provide an ample amount of sustainability, which is important in the current jungle. You have the option of beginning with either Despair or Tantrum when jungling. Tantrum is useful because the wolf camp, which Amumu begins his route at, has high attack speed and three separate monsters attacking. Therefore, you have the freedom to spam Tantrum while reducing a significant amount of incoming damage. Beginning with Despair leaves you more vulnerable to early damage, but you will have higher DPS overall against the blue buff, and will make you less dependent on your teammates for a leash. My personal preference is Tantrum, since its damage reduction fills a void that I have felt since I replaced the Greater Quintessence of Armor with Greater Quintessence of Movement Speed.<br /><br />
After you’ve purchased your items and allocated your skill point, begin your route by clearing wolves, asking for assistance from your nearby laners. Keep in mind due to the high movement speed of this particular camp, it is not efficient to attempt a leash similar to how blue buff is generally handled. Draw aggro from the camp yourself, and have your laners auto-attack the wolves without last hitting them; otherwise they will steal some of the experience that you need to hit level 4 at the end of this route. If you're new to playing Amumu in the jungle, it would be wise to start at Blue Buff and get a leash from your middle lane before going to wolves.<br /><br />
After clearing wolves, head up to blue buff after. Optimally, you will have cleared wolves around 1:50 if your teammates gave you sufficient aid, allowing you to be prepared when the golem spawns at 1:55. Have your mid laner leash it over the wall with an auto-attack or ability, and utilize Tantrum as often as possible. Save Smite for finishing the kill on the buff in order to safely secure it. If you use Smite early, you put yourself at risk for the enemy jungle to waltz in and smite-steal it themselves. This is detrimental to your jungle since it provides you with mana regeneration and cooldown reduction to allow early spamming for the fast clearing of camps, and sustainability throughout your route.<br /><br />
After clearing the camp and leveling up, take a point in Despair, and move on to wraith camp by crossing through the back of middle lane.<br />
The wraiths are one of the camps Amumu is extremely efficient at clearing. They have small health bars, low damage, and four separate monsters that attack you, allowing frequent Tantrum spam, and quick experience. While it is easy for Amumu to abuse this camp, keep in mind that mid laners tend to have more use for the extra gold and experience, and you will want to let them take it if they want it. Feel free to abuse this camp early game, however, especially since it respawns every 50 seconds as opposed to 1 minute.<br /><br />
One of the larger changes to the route is the switch from clearing golems to returning to wolves again. However, if you proceed there immediately, they will not have respawned. Take this time to quickly check your red buff for invaders, and then proceed back to the wolf camp, which should be easy to clear with both Despair and Tantrum. If your allied laners did not steal any experience from either your first wolf camp or blue buff, you should now be level 3, and be able to take a second point in Tantrum.<br /><br />
It is at this point you will want to proceed to the red buff in the bottom half of the jungle. You will use a similar strategy as previous camps to clear it with one important note. Like blue buff, there is always risk of an enemy jungler moving into your jungle and attempting to steal the buff. One way they might do this is by hiding in the brush along the southern wall of the red buff camp area. In order to avoid this, simply pull the lizard into the brush so you they can’t surprise you while you’re in the middle of clearing it. And, like blue buff, finish the camp with Smite to secure the buff for yourself and prevent theft by the enemy team.<br /><br />
Finally, clearing wraith camp one more time will finish your initial jungle clear, and should bring you to level 4.<br /><br />
From this point onward you have several options. The first one of these is to execute a gank. Look at the states of all the lanes and answer these two questions:<br />
+Is a lane struggling or getting zoned?<br />
+Is that lane also pushed or in a position that allows you to give your lane a significant advantage?<br /><br />
If you answered yes to both of those questions, then it's generally a good idea to gank. And even in the case where you said no to either question, sometimes there are cases where it will still be a good idea to gank. It is up to you to make these decisions that will be the most beneficial for your team. It is necessary to properly balance farming your jungle, ganking, and paying attention to key objectives such as the dragon in order to provide the largest benefits to your team. Make it a goal for your first recall to buy Spirit Stone, and a Sight Ward at the very least.<br />

<br /><h3 id="mid">Mid game (Ganking)</h3>
One of the important jobs of any jungler is to gank. In case anyone is new to jungling, ganking refers to leaving your jungle temporarily in order to join one of your allies in a lane with the intent of pressuring it in some way, usually a kill. This is the best way to assist your laners and really give them an edge against their opponent(s). In solo queue, ganking is the best way to be aggessive as Amumu during the earlier stages of the game since his counter-jungling abilites are subpar.<br /><br />
When going into a gank, there are a lot of things to consider. Not only do you have to plan how you will use your own abilities, but you have to consider the potential of your ally to aid in the gank, and the potential of your enemy to escape.<br /><br />
For instance, consider a solo top Shen. Shen is very durable and hardly capable of being bursted down by an enemy. Additionally, he has a gap closer and CC in the form of Shadow Dash. Knowing this, it would be ideal for him to initiate a gank, either by baiting the enemy into a "1v1" duel, or using Shadow Dash at the enemy. It would be at this point that you walk out at the enemy, but don't use your Bandage Toss or Curse of the Sad Mummy until the duration of the taunt from Shadow Dash has ended or come close to ending. This maximizes the duration the enemy is disabled.<br /><br />
When considering an enemy's potential to escape, we'll compare Darius and Vladimir. Ganking Darius is fairly easy compared to many champions. He lacks mobility or any sort of escape mechanism outside of summoner spell Flash which has a fairly long cooldown. This means repeated ganks could prove fatal since he lacks the tools to stop you. Vladimir, however, is fairly adept at avoiding ganks. His Sanguine Pool makes him untargetable and immune to all damage aside from DoTs placed onto him before activating the ability. This is generally used in combination with Ghost to move great distances while being untargetable. This means your Bandage Toss will travel straight through him and Despair and Tantrum will do no damage for the duration. When dealing with champions such as Vladimir, you need to establish a strategy that can be used to exploit the weaknesses that the ability has. Those of Sanguine Pool include it's high cooldown and hefty cost of 20% of his health. Two distinct strategies for successfully ganking Vladimir are:<br /><br />
+Allied Laner - Olaf: Separated CC usage. Having a laner with his/her own CC means that you can spread it out. In the image below, Olaf uses Undertow, attempting to slow Vladimir so he can't get away. However, Vladimir uses Sanguine Pool to dodge the axe and begins backing off. As soon as he comes out of Sanguine Pool, I immediately throw Bandage Toss, stunning him in place, and giving us the kill.<br /><br />
+Allied Laner - Akali: Repeated ganks/Camping. When your laner lacks an effective CC, Vladimir will more than likely be able to hold onto his Sanguine Pool until you try to Bandage Toss him. However, Sanguine Pool has a really long cooldown of 26 seconds at level 1, compared to 16 seconds for level 1 Bandage Toss. In order to take advantage of this, you exit the lane through the river, but hide in the bush nearby until Bandage Toss is off cooldown. Once it is, you immediately go in for another gank in the case that Vladimir decided to move up the lane again. Even if he doesn't, at the very least you gave Akali an advantage since Vladimir lost 20% of his health in order to use Sanguine Pool.<br /><br />
<h5>Note: Tower Diving</h5>
Oftentimes your allied laner has already asserted his dominance and is pushed towards the enemy turret. If your ally and you have the damage, or the enemy has already lost a significant portion of his health, it may be a good idea to turret dive. There are a couple strategies that can be used to turret diving, depending on how far the game has progressed and the type of enemy being dealt with. Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need to be the one tanking the turret if not ideal.<br /><br />
Standard Dive: If you have an obvious advantage and it would be safe for you and your allied laner to dive, then you can initiate with Bandage Toss, or simply run out behind them if you want to save Bandage Toss for the possible situation in which they abandon their turret position and begin to retreat down the lane. In this example, Teemo has been beaten up fairly significantly by Renekton, but is holding his position at the turret trying to get a little more farm before backing.<br /><br />
Lower Level Dive/The Enemy has Burst: In these cases, you will want to take a safe approach. Signal your ally that you would like to dive the enemy, and initiate it. You will want to lead in with your Bandage Toss, and back off immediately. With this strategy, you are tanking the turret, while your allied laner can quickly do the necessary damage to finish off the enemy. The reason this is the strategy to take against a burst opponent like Darius is that it is possible that if you remain near him while tanking turret aggro, he could focus you and try to make the dive turn into a 1v1 trade through the combination of the damage from his Noxian Guillotine and turret aggro.<br />

<br /><h3 id="late">Late game (Teamfights)</h3>
As the game progresses, teamfights will start to occur. If your lanes and you did well early game, then you have the potential to dominate these fights and increase your advantage. If you didn’t, you’ll have a more difficult time overcoming the enemy team. Either way, teamfights require you and your team to play intelligently and have a quick reaction time.
Amumu’s primary roles in a teamfight include serving as the initiator, tanking damage, and using your CC to lock down the enemy team. Before a teamfight, you will want to look for an opportunity to initiate, whether an enemy is out of position, an important ability to the enemy team is on cooldown, you need to stop them from taking an objective, or the enemy team has a stronger poke than you.<br /><br />
Example Scenario 1: Both teams are positioned near Baron, waiting for the opportunity to either start a fight or take Baron. When you look at your ever useful mini-map, you notice the enemy Graves is trying to get some farm in the bottom lane. In this case, you would want to either start a teamfight, or begin to take Baron. Without the AD Carry, the enemy team can’t do anything to stop you, and will lose team members if they try.<br /><br />
Example Scenario 2: The enemy Ashe fires her Enchanted Crystal Arrow at your team, but everyone is able to dodge it, and it flies uselessly across the map. The instant this happens, you should immediately counter-initiate and Bandage Toss the nearest person of the enemy team. Without this important CC, you have a much better chance of winning.<br /><br />
Example Scenario 3: Your team arrives at dragon to find that the enemy team has already taken out half of its health. However, they have lost some of their health and their positioning is rather poor for engaging in the teamfight. In this case, you can start a teamfight over dragon since the gold is rather important and benefits all of your team members. In some cases, the dragon may be attacking the AD Carry on the enemy team. Unless your team is at an extreme disadvantage, you should always engage, since the dragon’s attacks apply an attack speed debuff, reducing the effectiveness of that Vayne to near zero. If dragon begins to get low enough for your Smite to finish it during the fighting, make an effort to secure it before their jungler.<br /><br />
Example Scenario 4: In many cases, both teams have grouped up in mid lane looking for an opportunity to push. If the enemy team is composed of characters such as Xerath, Nidalee, and Ashe with long range pokes, they can potentially harass you out and prevent a teamfight altogether. In these situations, it is ideal to initiate as soon as physically possible. A combo such as Flash, Bandage Toss, Curse of the Sad Mummy can end a poke war before it even begins. By using your ultimate relatively quickly, your team has the opportunity to catch up to you before they’re kited back to the enemy turret.<br /><br />
Obviously, these aren’t the only cases in which you could begin a fight. Sometimes, your teams are at a stalemate, and you’re confident you can win, feel free to initiate. These are just the ideal situations that are generally advantageous to your team.<br /><br />
During a teamfight, your primary goal is to get into position to get the most out of your huge AoE damage. Therefore, the best place for you is right in the middle of the enemy team. If you can lock down all five of their team members with Curse of the Sad Mummy, then you have already benefitted the team in a huge way. Other AoE ultimates synergize well with Curse of the Sad Mummy, making them easier to hit when their team is locked down. For instance, Miss Fortune's ultimate Bullet Time has the potential to do major damage to the enemy team if they stand in it for the full duration. They can easily run out of the area, while Miss Fortune is channeling, or simply stun her to end it artificially. If Bullet Time and Curse of the Sad Mummy are used together, the entire enemy team is generally forced to suffer a huge amount of damage. Situations like these are important to consider when deciding how to utilize your ultimate most effectively.<br /><br />
However, pay attention to your health, since even Amumu will die quickly if all five members of their team decide to focus you. The last thing you want to do is fail to activate your ultimate before dying.<br /><br />
Despair should always be on during a teamfight, constantly damaging and slowing the enemy team if you’ve already bought Rylai's Crystal Scepter. Additionally, Tantrum should be used every time it comes off cooldown. Mid game Bandage Toss will most likely not come off cooldown during the fight itself if it was used to initiate. However, it can be used to catch anyone fleeing from the fight, or to buy your team some time to escape if you happen to lose.<br />

To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Amumu again :-)<br /><br />
Ultimately, Amumu is a great champion that brings a lot to the table in terms of crowd control and damage. By using just Curse of the Sad Mummy, he has the potential to snare the entire enemy team with correct positioning. Know ahead of time that Amumu is not a carry, and you will likely not end with an absurd amount of kills. Rather, it's Amumu's job to ensure the people who can get these kills have an easier time doing it.<br />
