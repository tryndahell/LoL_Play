<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
If you are looking at this guide, the odds are that you want to learn how to start playing Ahri or play her better. Or you just came here because the title said something about Foxfire Ahri and perked your interests. IDK. Anyways, I hope this helps your quest for Ahri domination.<br />

RED:<br />Magic pen Reds are basically the only viable thing for casters. They help get rid of the enemies' pesky magic resistance and helps you do more damage. Everyone always builds MR runes so you might as well make them all useless.<br />
YELLOW:<br />Mana regen for more early game harass. I usually take these so I can use abilities more in the early game without being completely dependent on blue buff.<br />
BLUE:<br />Ability Power per level for a slightly stronger late game presence; they give nearly 3x the AP of Greater Glyph of Ability Power at level 18.<br />
BROWN:<br />Flat AP Quints are generally the best way to go for AP Mids. Increases your damage output, and when is that ever bad?<br />

<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/ignite.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span><br />Ahri already has 3 dashes with her ult, why take Flash? Flash will help you escape from a gank pre-6 or when your Spirit Rush is on cooldown, or for the desperate situations that require 4 flashes. It's saved my life countless times. Definitely a must-have.<br />
Note: If you have not unlocked Flash yet, then a proper replacement would be Ghost.<br />
<span class="spell">IGNITE</span><br />
Will add that extra bit of damage to your burst to and can make the difference from your enemy escaping with 15 health followed by a table flip, to a nice and solid kill. Also, you get a nifty 5 bonus AD and AP with the Offense mastery (Summoner's Wrath) when it's on cooldown.<br />
<br />
ALTERNATIVES<br />
<img src="../../img/spells/cleanse.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/exhaust.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/barrier.png" /><br />
<img src="../../img/spells/teleport.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/ghost.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">CLEANSE</span><br />
This also works well on Ahri because getting stunned in a teamfight will get you killed, and you will be sad because you never got a chance to use your ult to escape, and your team will die and get mad, and your nexus will blow up. Works really against teams with heavy cc.<br />
<span class="spell">EXHAUST</span><br />
You can also take an Exhaust for those 1v1 duels or chasing someone with the slow. I wouldn't recommend it because you already have that Charm.<br />
<span class="spell">BARRIER</span><br />
This is okay if your enemy can burst you down instantly. Not recommended though generally, but fares well if against Veigar, LeBlanc, or other heavy bursters.<br />
<span class="spell">TELEPORT</span><br />
You can take Teleport if you are going top for some reason to get back into lane faster. Not recommended since you will basically be down a summoner in your lane.<br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
Only if your level isn't high enough for Flash; otherwise, Flash outclasses Ghost infinitely because you're not a melee initiator.<br />

Orb of Deception synergizes well with your passive. If you hit the enemy at the very tip of the orb, both procs will occur simultaneously. They can't dodge that! U Mad squishy mid enemy? Max it first for a small nuke of damage. The true damage part of it is always nice against enemies who stack tons of MR. Play enough so you understand the range of this spell and learn to smartcast it. It will change the game.</td></tr>

Some people are experimenting with maxing this first, but I don't recommend it unless you're against a champ that needs to be close range to do damage (Katarina).

Charm and watch the tower murder him. Spirit Rush down and need to run away? Hit 'em with a Charm and watch them slow down for some much-needed escape time. Teamfight? Try to hit the ad carry and follow up with Orb of Deception and Fox-Fire. It's a lovely spell and you will sometimes have people raging. Like your Orb of Deception, you should aim to smart cast this when you are familiar with the range. This is basically what makes Ahri useful late game. Late game Charm on AD carry = Won teamfight.</td></tr>

Spam that Spirit Rush and dash to safety. Oh no, there's a small wall behind you and an enemy is closing in! NOPE. Spirit Rush over that wall. They Flashed? Spirit Rush back over. Flawless Victoryyyy! It's okay to blow all 3 dashes to run away. Remember, it is not worth seeing if you can escape without using your ult. Just use it, the cooldown is not that long. When you're laying on the floor dead, you'll probably be regretting that you were so stingy on the ult.
When your ult is on CD, you are super vulnerable and should be extra cautious. Try not to start a fight with a 15 seconds cooldown on your ult. </td></tr>

Boots now have 25 less move speed, but every champion now has 25 more move speed. What does this mean? Well, boots are now a whole lot less important. You can get away with delaying purchasing boots for longer. But most of the time, I still start out with Boots of Speed on Ahri because that 25 bonus move speed is crucial to dodging skillshots and are extremely important against champs like Karthus, Cassiopeia, or Brand. It also plays a huge part in escaping early ganks. Also, starting Boots of Speed allows me to also start with 4 Health Potions for sustainability.</tr>

<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/rabadons-deathcap.png"></td><td class="left">Once you build this sucker, your damage will send the enemy running as soon as they see you. It gives a TON of AP and AP = tons of damage. If all goes well, you will have this around 17-20 minutes. This is arguably one of the best AP items in the game and your enemies won't have that much magic resistance yet. This is your time to dominate. It increases your damage by an insane amount, so basically, BUY THIS.<br />
Note If you find yourself losing your lane, this might not be the best choice. Instead buy a Rylai's Crystal Scepter since that will provide utility for your team. Rabadon's Deathcap is an item for people who are generally doing well in lane.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/rylais-crystal-scepter.png"></td><td class="left">Next, I grab a Rylai's Crystal Scepter. This works really well on Ahri. Reaaaally well. It gives you a lot of health for some tankiness and survivabiliteh so you can stay in those small duels for longer times. It gives you AP and AP = tons of damage. It gives you a slow. Your Orb of Deception, Fox-Fire, Charm, and Spirit Rush (every single skill) will apply the slow which will:<br />
1. Help your teammates chase down the runners in teamfights<br />
2. Help you chase down the runners in 1v1s<br />
3. Help you run away with 3 enemies on your tails; simply toss out any skill behind you and they won't catch up to you ^^.<br />
I recommend trying to get this every game. If you're really good at this game, you should get it first since you want your teammates to get the kills when you gank (instead of yourself) and the slow will help them greatly. But that's seen in higher elo play and not seen in low-elo games, when everyone (except maybe the support) is trying to get a kill for themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/zhonyas-hourglass.png"></td><td class="left">This item is amazing on AP Casters, such as Ahri. It will save your life many times if used properly. Don't get it too early though, since the armor is a lot better for late game than early game as your enemy will most likely be doing magic damage. The active alone counters the kits of so many champions. A simple click of the active will make numerous painful ults such as Karthus's Requiem, Brand's Pyroclasm, Fizz's Chum the Waters, Caitlyn's Ace in the Hole fizzle out and become useless. It's quite the item, highly recommended.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/deathfire-grasp.png"></td><td class="left">The new DFG is pretty sweet. Since it does damage based on percent current health it is best to use it when an enemy is at high hp. The 20% increased damage is also pretty amazing as it makes your combo do more damage. After getting this, you should be scaring the enemy AD or AP carry with your ability to pretty much 1-shot them. I would consider this item pretty core on Ahri. An assassin item for an assassin champion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/liandrys-torment.png"></td><td class="left">It builds from Haunting Guise. That makes Haunting Guise a good item since you don't have to sell it anymore. It gives health for some tankiness. It gives Magic Pen which is really good for dealing nice damage. It gives a sweet passive that will help shred the hp on tanks. You get bonus shredding if you have a Rylai's also, for some sick synergy. Oh, and Fox-Fire counts as a 3x single-target spell so it does tons of damage.</td></tr>

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game</h3>
Okay, the game starts up. First of all, you probably need to leash your jungler. This means that you should launch an Orb of Deception as soon as the blue buff or red buff spawns (depending on where your jungler decides to start). The top or bot lane should be doing the most damage to the golem/lizard, so feel free to go back to alne after a few auto-attacks. If the jungler want to start at wraiths or wolves (since they spawn a few seconds before the buffs), launch a few auto-attacks on them after your jungler starts to attack. Just make sure you don't accidentally last hit one, especially the big one, because your jungler will probably either rage at you or sarcastically type "..." in chat to convince your team that you obviously need go back to the Proving Grounds.<br /><br />
Now you stroll back to your lane, which most likely is mid. This means last hitting. Don't constantly auto attack the minions. Auto attacking will push your lane outwards, and you will be forced to be closer to their turret in order to continue last hitting. The enemy jungler can stroll behind you, and you'll probably die from an deserved gank. Also, a pushed lane will mean that your jungler cannot gank from your side. Double-lose.<br /><br />
Feel free to push hard if they don't have a jungler, or if the game is approaching mid game. And use your Orb of Deception for harassing since it does quite a chunk of damage to them (or unless you like to see an empty mana bar for some reason). Getting the enemy low enough with your Q sets up for a early kill for your combo.<br /><br />
Using a full combo of Charm, Orb of Deception, and Fox-Fire will drain about a third of your mana instantly, so try to refrain from doing a full combo unless you are sure you won't completely miss everything (mainly depends on hitting Charm).<br /><br />
Keep on harassing them. Try to keep their health low. You need to play Ahri a looot, but eventually you will be able to tell when a E>Q>W> Ignite combo will be able to secure the kill. It's not worth it if they still survive. Overall, I can't stress how important it is to obtain every creep score.<br /><br />
It is very important to note that pre-6 might be the only time you can press your advantage against certain champs. If the enemy is an Akali, Veigar or a Kassadin, do whatever you can to totally ruin their laning phase. Seriously, I mean it. If you let these guys farm freely, once they turn 6, you're going to be in a whole world of hurt.<br /><br />
To be Concise...<br />
- If you have an early game advantage, constantly harass them with auto-attacks, Orb of Deception, and Fox-Fire.<br />
- Try to win trades.<br />
- If you don't have early game advantage, do your best to not get out-traded by your opponent.<br />
- Usually Ahri will have the early game advantage.<br />
- Remember to focus on last-hitting minions!!<br />

<br /><h3 id="mid">Mid game</h3>
Now you've hit level 6. Your über ult is now up. Hopefully your laning opponent will have somewhat medium-ish health by now (given that you haven't already killed him/her yet). This takes many Ahri games worth of experience, but you should be able to tell if you can kill the enemy laner with one huge burst.<br /><br />
People that are not familiar with Ahri will not know how high your kill potential is at 6. This is your chance.<br /><br />
Your burst should look something like R>E>Q>R>W>R> Ignite, and at 6, it should pretty much Garen-tee a kill. By starting with a Spirit Rush towards your opponent, you can jump out of a minion wave and land a secure Charm. After level 6, you want to start constantly ganking the other lanes due to Ahri's advantage of high mobility/strong cc ganks. Push your lane hard and start roaming.<br /><br />
When you both hit 6, your laning opponent is probably now either much better than you, or much worse than you. If he/she is now stronger than you, you need to focus on helping your other lanes get kills. It will help your team much more than getting constantly wrecked by your laning opponent.<br /><br />
The odds are, for the majority of low-elo or normal games, wards are not be frequently used. Top lane should be vulnerable for an easy kill (check if the enemy top has Wriggle's Lantern for the free ward first(s3 edit: lol can u remember when top laners used to buy that)) or ask your top if the enemy has laid a Sight Ward). If you want to gank bot, go through your jungle if you are Blue team, or go through the enemy jungle if you are Purple team. Keep on ganking.<br /><br />
Important note! Using your ult for damage is not always the best choice. Sometimes if you are ganking and you see the enemy is running back to their tower (since they obviously see you via ward) use your ult to get closer to them faster to get a kill! If you save your ult until you catch them, you might not actually catch them. Sure you waste the damage portion of the Spirit Rush, but if you get a kill, it doesn't matter. Although if you do this, please be fairly certain that you can get the kill, wasting it for nothing would be bad~<br /><br />
You want to ensure that your lanes end up winning, so your AD carry, such as Vayne or Graves can demolish everyone in team fights. Ahri is unbelievably good at small skirmishes (3v2's or 3v3's that happen often bot lane during a gank), and you should have a pretty nice score by now. If you happen to fall too many levels behind your team (i.e. 2 or 3), farm in a safe spot that will not get you ganked by the opponent.<br /><br />
To be Concise...<br />
- Continue doing your best to win trades.<br />
- Build appropriate items according to your situation.<br />
- If a lane is gankable, push out your lane and then gank that lane!! Getting a kill or having them blow summoners is well worth your time.<br />
- Ask for the jungler to hold mid tower if you need him to. Know when you can all-in your opponent successfully for a kill.<br />

<br /><h3 id="late">Late game</h3>
You do significantly less at this point.<br /><br />
Generally you want to just spam out everything during the huge teamfights. Cooldown Reduction is vital now. You should save your Spirit Rush for either running away or chasing down the fleeing enemies. Using Spirit Rush at the beginning/middle of the fight will just cause the enemy team to run away, and you will lose your chasing/escaping tool.<br /><br />
However, if you completely dominated up to this point, then your damage should be nothing to sneeze at. It should be completely possible to insta-gib the enemy AP or AD carry with 1 combo. In doing so, you can easily win teamfights, and in other words, the game. That's why it's good to get fed in the mid game.<br /><br />
Hopefully, the other members of your team should be fed due to your consta-ganking during midgame, and you should win. Note that initiating a fight by landing a Charm on a squishy enemy carry, not the tank, will almost ensure that your team will win that fight or score at least one kill as long as everyone is paying attention and focusing the right target.<br /><br />
To be Concise...<br />
- Stick with your team to take objectives.<br />
- In team fights, you should save your Charm for the AD carry or the AP carry.<br />
- Do your best to kill them ASAP.<br />
- Use your Spirit Rush primarily to chase down enemies or add to your burst.<br />
- If you take out their back line, you will win the teamfights a.k.a the game.<br />

<br /><h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Ahri again :-)<br /><br />
<li>Learn the A-move. If you press "a" and left-click on the ground, your champion will start walking there and start attacking any enemy it encounters along the path to the place you clicked. Great for last-hitting if the closest minion to you is almost dead and you don't want to risk clicking the wrong one. A-move is even better for chasing low-hp enemies through bushes. Everyone knows that everyone loves juking. By pressing "a" and clicking on the other side of the bush, you will stop moving and start attacking them if they try to juke. A great skill to have, it will help you get many kills.</li>
<li>15 cs = 1 champ kill. That's just 2-3 waves. For laning phase, you need to last hit. Seriously, man. It's impossible to stress enough how much creep score matters.</li>
<li>Call your MIA's/ss. You need to alert your teammates of potential ganks. Yes, your teammates will rage at you if you don't call MIA and they die. Even if you recall or gank another lane, just say MIA to alert your teammates that you don't know where the enemy mid is located.
<li>Charming an enemy that is chasing you will slow them down a bit for you to escape.</li>
<li>If it's a crazy 1 hour+ game and your build is maxed, spend your extra gold on all 4, I mean 3 elixirs in the consumable section of the shop. ( Elixir of Fortitude, Elixir of Brilliance, and Oracle's Elixir).</li>
<li>The best way to get better at Ahri is to actually play her a lot. You will be able to judge her burst better, and that will cause more enemy deaths ^^ Practice, practice, practice.</li>
<li>If it's mid-game and you want to gank, push the minion line to your opponent's turret, and step back so he can't see you. When the minions come back, step back in and push the minions to the enemy turret again. Step back. Repeat this several times. Eventually he will stop calling MIA's to his team, and you can go gank a lane easily. If you've pushed your lane hard, you might as well mess with his head. It will be harder for him to last hit under a turret, and by stepping back, you are also protecting yourself from enemy jungler ganks.</li>
<li>Try to harass enemies with auto attacks in early levels as much as possible. Just be sure to account for minion aggro since they will start attacking you as soon as you do damage to the enemy. They do a surprising amount of damage to you at early levels.</li>
<li>Ahri's early game is relatively good compared to other AP mids. Sometimes, your only advantage will be before your enemy hits 6. You must attempt to deny minions from them and harass them by playing aggressively and making them fear getting close to minions. These enemies include Katarina, Veigar, and Kassadin, to name a few.</li>
<li>Other times, your enemy will have a waay better early game than you do. Focus on staying alive and getting to level 6. Then, keep on ganking other lanes.
<li>Are you getting tower-dived? Charm.</li>
<li>Smartcast your Orb of Deception and Charm after you are familiar with the ranges! It will help your game sooo much by getting rid of the delay of clicking :O</li>
<li>Her deathnoise will make the enemy team "distracted" so feeder Ahri is a legit build.
<li>^ That was a joke.</li>
<li>The rhythm game, Osu! is really good at improving mouse movement.</li>
