<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Hello and welcome to my guide on Nerfistar...I mean Alistar! Alistar is the only support that can brag about being both a healer and aggressive support. Since I have been playing, which is only about a year, Alistar was to me the uncontested best support. He is the support to shut down the infamous Blitzcrank.
<br />
Unfortunately after several nerfs he can no longer do as he pleases in almost every match up. I play Alistar now as a support tank with masteries helping him make up for his nerfed movement speed. Alistar is still top tier and is at the momement a popular ban banned.
<br />
Alistar really fits my play style. Typically when I'm playing support I want to do more than just stand in the bush (lol). I want to constantly intimidate, harass, and threaten the enemy. Alistar was the champion that could do that for me, and that is why he is my favorite champion.<br />

<br /><h3 id="proscons">Pros / Cons</h3>
<table>
<tr><td class="left">
<li>Both Agressive and Passive Support</li>
<li>Scales even without farm (like all supports)</li>
<li>Naturally Tanky</li>

<li>Direct counter to the highly banned Blitzcrank</li>
<li>Fun to play</li>
<li>Excellent peeler and initiator</li>
<li>Good roamer</li>
<li>Can handle good and bad situations in lane</li>
</td></tr><tr>
<td class="left">
<li>Nerfed</li>
<li>Difficult to play</li>

<li>Not the best warder</li>
<li>High mana usage</li>
<li>Low win rate</li>

</table><br />
RED:<br />The extra armor helps out a ton while laning. For marks you could choose between armor and magic pen. Usually I opt for armor, even though the marks are made for offense. The only time I use Insight runes is when I see we have alot of AP on our team, I also used Magic Pen runes when i didn't have the armor runes yet.<br />
YELLOW:<br />Again with the extra armor. For seals you can choose between armor or gold. I almost always go for armor. I find that you are just too squishy without armor, even with Alistar. Gold Seals are &quot;very&quot; optional.<br />
BLUE:<br />For blues I take Shielding. Very standard and highly recommended for almost any champ. You can also use CDR runes as well.<br />
BROWN:<br />For Quints you have a couple of options. In season 2 Gold Quints where my choice picks, that might change in this season. Movement Quints are also excellent choices. Ability power quints can be used if you plan on building for an AP team.<br /><br />

<br /><h3 id="spells">Summoner's spells</h3>
<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/ignite.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span><br />Almost every champ makes use of this spell. Perhaps  Alistar is one who can use it the best. It is absolutely deadly early game to quickly get into position early game.<br />
<span class="spell">IGNITE</span><br />
An excellent spell to support with. Plus who don't take the kill.<br />

<br />
ALTERNATIVES<br />
<img src="../../img/spells/heal.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/clarity.png" /><br />
<img src="../../img/spells/ghost.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/teleport.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">HEAL</span><br />
I grab it when a support doesn't have a built in heal, and I still grab it when Shurelya's wouldn't be used to dive into a fight. However Alistar can effectively use Shurelya's, so Heal wouldn't be as viable.<br />
<span class="spell">CLARITY</span><br />
Good on  Zilean maybe, but it's not worth a spell slot otherwise.<br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
It's better on champs who are naturally fast or have speed buffs built in. You don't,  Flash is just better on  Alistar.<br />
<span class="spell">TELEPORT</span><br />
Really nice spell to have on any team. If you addicted to it, it would be okay for you to get it. Just make sure to ask if it is okay.<br />

<br /><h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<table>
<tr><td><img src="alistar-trample.png" /></td><td>Trample</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Each time Alistar casts a spell, he gains the ability to move through units and will deal damage to nearby enemy units and structures for about 3 seconds. Trample deals double damage to minions and monsters.<br />Magic Damage per second: 6 (+ 1 x level) (+10% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">While it certainly has its uses, this spell is more valuable when  Alistar jungles. While supporting use it during a engagement to deal a good chunk of damage. If you are ever farming, say your carry is off somewhere or your stopping a pushed lane, use this to farm. As soon as those 3 seconds are done use another ability to keep it going. When your attacking a turret, also keep this on because it deals damage to them. This also removes unit collision, so there's that to keep in mind.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="alistar-pulverize.png" /></td><td>Pulverize<br />Cooldown: ?<br />Cost: ?<br />Range: ?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Alistar smashes the ground where he is standing, dealing damage to all surrounding enemies and knocking them up for 1 second, additionally stunning them upon landing for 0.5 seconds.<br />Magic Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+50% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">A knockup. One spell giving you essentially a 1.5 second stun at level one is OP.You can use this before or after a  Headbutt, either way the opponent is either gonna die, take serious damage, or use a summoner spell to escape. Use this in a middle of a teamfight to instantly give your team a advantage. Don't forgot this spell is how your going to deal most of your damage.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="alistar-headbutt.png" /></td><td>Headbutt<br />Cooldown: ?<br />Cost: ?<br />Range: ?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Alistar flourishes her kamas, hitting nearby units for 30/55/80/105/130 physical damage plus (+30% Ability Power and +60% Bonus Attack Damage).<br />Magic Damage: 55 / 110 / 165 / 220 / 275 (+70% AP)<br />Knockback Distance: 650</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">A knockback. This is a great tool to kill with, but it's also why Alistar is potentially one of the best tanks. He can get someone off one of his squishies with ease.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Alistar instantly restores health to himself, healing nearby friendly units for half of that amount. The cooldown of this ability is reduced by 2 seconds each time a nearby enemy unit dies.<br />Self Heal: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+20% AP)<br />Friendly Unit Heal: 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 (+10% AP)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Seems out of place on the cow at first but it's what separates him from other utility tanks. It's a nice AOE heal that can actually heal alot when your around your whole team.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Alistar instantly gains bonus attack damage and takes reduced physical and magic damage for 7 seconds. If he is under crowd control effects at the time of casting, they are also removed.<br />Bonus AD: 60 / 75 / 90<br />Damage Reduction: 50% / 60% / 70%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left" colspan="2">Your ult. Not very supporty, but always you to transition into a tank when you become focused. If you get locked in a bunch of cc you can use this + Shurelya's to easily escape. Don't forgot to use this during a engagement as soon as you finish your combo.</td></tr>

To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Alistar again :-)<br /><br />
Alistar is still a good champion, just balanced now. Gone are the days where he was king of the supports. He is not bad, just one of the most difficult to use effectively. Nobody, even now, wants to deal against a properly played minotaur.<br />
The guide will be continue to be updated as League of Legends is updated, along with more  Alistar experience.<br />
I hope you all enjoyed my guide! If you have anything you wish for me to add, leave me a comment! Have a nice day!<br />
