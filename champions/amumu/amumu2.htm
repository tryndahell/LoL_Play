<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Hello people, and welcome to my Amumu guide. Amumu is a really really great champion, and before you downvote it'd be nice if you would at least try my build's effectiveness in game. Amumu is a great initiator and my build makes him very durable. He is a potent ganker, an underestimated laner, and overall a very strong character, becoming both tanky and having a high damage output with few damage items. While many Amumu players like to jungle with him, I find that a little too slow for my tastes. It also uses a summoner spell slot up, and I really don't feel like I can afford that (At least with my personal playstyle).<br />

<br /><h3 id="proscons">Pros / Cons</h3>

</table><br />
RED:<br />There's no question that it really is the best mark choice for this build<br />
YELLOW:<br />Seals are interchangeable. I find that Greater Seal of Armor are the best mainly for Amumu's ability to harass early game with Tantrum, although you may wish to use Greater Seal of Health or Greater Seal of Scaling Mana Regeneration.<br />
BLUE:<br />Concerning glyphs, I like to run Greater Glyph of Scaling Magic Resist. They outpace Greater Glyph of Magic Resist by level 10, which is when your game presence should really pick up and your magic resistance will most likely not measure up to your armor. We want a well-rounded tank all about and the extra MR will make a difference.<br />
BROWN:<br />Quintessences are also interchangeable. I prefer Greater Quintessence of Movement Speed because as their name implies they allow me to move quickly, allowing me to position myself late game for Bandage Toss and early games for Tantrum.<br /><br />

<br /><h3 id="spells">Summoner's spells</h3>
<img src="../../img/spells/ignite.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span><br />Used to gain distance between enemies. Flash + Shadow Dance[R] = Godly Range! You can also use Flash to escape any gank or team fight if it isn't favorable to you. Flashing through walls can save your life or can enable you to kill an enemy.<br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
Ignite is a summoner spell which I prefer, knowing my luck the majority of time my opponent escapes with barely any life left. Well Ignite solves that problem for me, dealing true damage over time it finishes off the opponent for me.<br />

<br />
ALTERNATIVES<br />

<img src="../../img/spells/teleport.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/cleanse.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">EXHAUST</span><br />
Can be used to slow the enemy down for that needed area to be able to Shadow Dance[R] onto the champion. Also decreases damage dealt to you and can be used to escape. Get this summoner if they have a lot of AD on their team.<br />
<span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
Allows you to gain movement speed to chase or escape from an enemy champion effectively. Able to run through those pesky minions that get in your way! Although, Flash is still a better choice.<br />
<span class="spell">TELEPORT</span><br />
This spell is very useful to protect your turret(s) or even an ally(s) when needed, blinking in by teleporting to a minion or ward in the middle of a team fight can change the tide of a game. <br />
<span class="spell">CLEANSE</span><br />
Use this summoner if the enemy team has a lot of crowd control.<br />

The main reason why this is bought is for the spell vamp boost, and active passive.

<h5>Note</h5>
Different teams call for different items, you do not use this build for every game! There are items depending on the team you are up against such as magic resist items, etc.which will greatly attribute to you and your team.<br />

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game</h3>
I have received some feedback stating that players are having trouble with Amumu in the early game laning phase, so I have added this section to further explain it.

Amumu is the most difficult to play at level 1-5 because she lacks strong long range harass without Shadow Dance to close the distance. It is extremely easy to feed with her, like all squishy melee champs, and these levels are critical to setting the platform for the rest of the game, so it is important to play smart.

She is best in a solo lane versus a carry.  She can farm up on creep, and possibly get a kill or two on their carry. She needs to have a strong laning phase, and carry hard early game through mid game. She just cannot carry and survive late end game, simply because she's melee and focused too much. Eventually they will get smart and buy an Oracle's, or 3... Your job at that point is primarily to take out low health champs, and sometimes kamikaze against their carry so they lose their DPS. You will die more often end game... and your wonderful "carry" k/d ratio will plummet.<br />

<br /><h3 id="mid">Mid game</h3>
Amumu cannot sustain full map lane pushes if she uses Crescent Slash a lot. It will eat her energy extremely quickly, and it is energy that she needs to defend herself or to dash into combat. Her best ability to farm long term is Mark of the Assassin, and limit Crescent Slash to once/twice per single wave.<br /><br />
When she encounters a very large creep wave, Crescent Slash can obliterate them very quickly. This skill does the best spread of damage on the wave when the wave is mobile. Once the ranged creep fan out across the lane it will not hit them all. Sometimes it is best to wait for the wave to push through your creep and become mobile again. Once they group up, Shadow Dance to the creep at the center and immediately spam Crescent Slash.<br />

<br /><h3 id="late">Late game</h3>
She does very well in the jungle, so be sure to take out the jungle creep while roaming (obviously if there is no jungle). It leaves more gold and exp to those laning, and overall more gold and exp for the team. But obviously, don't spend all of your time in the jungle, Amumu is an assassin, so go do some assassinating and take out unsuspecting champs in lanes. Spending some time in the jungle after the laning phase intimidates all lanes while you're MIA.<br /><br />
In a group fight with Amumu, knowing when to jump in is the most important decision. She should never ever initiate the group fight as she will die in a split second against a prepared group. It's a completely different story if they are unprepared...<br /><br />
Once the group fight starts and you see a decent amount of sparks fly (specifically targetable stuns/silences), immediately [item_text=Shadow Dance] to the squishiest highest DPS champ and take them out with your high burst damage. With her burst DPS it will only take a few seconds. If the team is good, most of them will quickly turn their spells to you and you will see your HP start to fall, but since you waited, most of their spells are on CD and their DPS will be lower, so immediately drop Twilight Shroud and do nothing. This is very important because you will stealth in combat and it will temporarily confuse them. They will blindly throw in skill shots, and waste AoE's, hopefully saving your team from most of that damage.<br /><br />
This confusion is critical to Amumu in a team fight. With her speed and intimidating burst damage, enemies will want to hold their skills to use on you, yet the longer they hold them, the less DPS and CC they are doing to the rest of your team. In a short moment, the confusion will quickly turn to panic, and their team cohesion will weaken. They will be less likely to focus on one target, and will spread the damage more evenly across your team.<br /><br />
Again hold your actions until you see a few sparks fly, then burst damage down the next highest DPS squishiest champ. If their team is good, you will likely not survive the next wave of damage, however you alone took out a large chunk of their DPS. My Amumu is frequently the only casualty on our side of a 5v5 group fight, with a total wipe on their side. Absolutely worth the death in my opinion.<br /><br />
If you are utilizing this tactic effectively, very often your opponents will buy an oracle potion or a vision ward! Pay attention to this counter tactic, because unfortunately, it works very well...<br />

<br /><h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Amumu again :-)<br /><br />
<li>When using  Twilight Shroud make sure to walk on the edges of the bubble, if the champions decide to blindly use their abilities on you, they usually aim for the middle.</li>
<li>You can use  Twilight Shroud to check bushes safely, so you don't face-check.</li>
<li>When looking at the amount of energy you have, determine whether it is needed to use Twilight Shroud at all.</li>
<li>Twilight Shroud has an innate slow, so using that effectively can slow down opponents enough to catch up to them, or even slow them down to help your team-mates and yourself get at a safe distance from the enemy.</li>
<li>When you use your first  Mark of the Assassin in the  Twilight Shroud make sure to wait it out in the bubble until your  Mark of the Assassin comes off cool-down. This decreases the amount of damage inflicted upon yourself.</li><br />
If you enjoy playing mind games, instilling fear and confusion, and like playing glass cannon champs, Amumu is for you. Amumu is an amazing burst damage champ, however she is very squishy so you need to be careful. Speed and deception are your allies, so make good use of Shadow Dance, things like Flash, and in-combat stealth. Always underestimate her survivability, else she will drop like a rock if you don't take care of her. Respect her, love her, and she will put a smile on your face and at times a cackle in your laugh as you tear through enemy champs.<br />
