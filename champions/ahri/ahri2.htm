<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Hi, I'm EZ Zythian and I'm the AP carry player for Team EZ. One thing that's important to note about a lot of my core AP heros is that my builds are pretty static. It's very rare that I stray from the builds I'll put on my guides, not that it never happens. I find the builds here are typically best in all scenarios, but that doesn't mean I don't occasionally make tweaks from game to game.<br /><br />
On to Ahri! So why choose Ahri as your AP carry? Ahri's mobility is probably the #1 reason. She's a great counter to some staple heros in middle, like Karthus and Morgana and her roaming power is incredible. She has a strong CC for ganks, initiations, and pickoffs, and the mobility to move in to score kills and get out safely without even using Flash. This is where Ahri really excels.<br /><br />
You can see my stream at http://www.twitch.tv/zythian and follow me on facebook http://www.facebook.com/Zythian and twitter @EZZythian and our entire team at http://www.teamez.com<br />

BROWN:<br />Flat AP is pretty standard on AP carries right now.<br />

<br /><h3 id="spells">Summoner's spells</h3>
<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/ignite.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span><br />Flash is pretty much essential on most AP carries, but I find it particularly useful on Ahri mainly because sometimes you're forced to use your ult into bad positions to secure kills. Flash helps you get out of that position, like a 4th charge of Spirit Rush.<br />
<span class="spell">IGNITE</span><br />
I choose ignite to combo mainly in lane, but also at many other times throughout the game. Without ignite it's much harder to solo someone down in lane in your full combo. With ignite you can 100-0 pretty much anyone in a combo.<br /><br />

I only really purchase this item now against strong harass champions or those who also have a lot of spell vamp (vlad, kat with revolver, etc.) Since Fox-Fire is considered a single-target spell you gain full spell vamp for each charge of the spell, resulting in a very significant amount of health returned. This allows you to out-sustain basically any lane by just harassing or farming with Fox-Fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/deathfire-grasp.png"></td><td class="left">
I rush this item in nearly all situations now. The added burst into your rotation is incredible. It allows you to 100-0 any champ in the game. Used right as you dash in for the first time it just synergizes perfectly with Ahri.</td></tr>

</table>

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game</h3>
Ahri's Pre-6 laning is extremely strong. Her abilities have pretty low mana costs and allow you to play very aggressive early into the game, securing level 6 and sometimes even earlier kills. As with any carry, farm is incredibly important, especially at these early levels, so while harassing your opponent is always good, if no one scores a kill and you've been missing cs to harass and your opponent is out-cs'ing you, you've lost the lane.<br /><br />
You need to balance farming with harassing on Ahri. As appealing as it is to try and zone your opponent and try to score a kill, it often puts you in bad positions pre-6 to be ganked and missing cs is never to your advantage. To counter this, I'll usually use Orb of Deception to last hit a minion while I aim at the enemy solo. This allows me to get my harass shots in, farm minions, and keep pressure up in lane.<br /><br />
When you have no minions to last hit soon, but you know your lane opponent does, that's when you can move up to play more aggressive, using Fox-Fire and/or an orb to push him off the wave, forcing him to eat damage or miss cs. You don't want to do this if it's going to hurt your last hitting in the process. The focus has to be on forcing him into awkward positions, not forcing yourself into them.<br /><br />
Once you're level 4, your opponent should either be low or atleast have gone through a health potion or 2. You can look for a kill opportunity with your jungle, or just look to put a lot of pressure out with a Charm if possible. If you can force your opponent to have to back earlier than you and give you the chance to get level 6 first, you've pretty much won the lane.<br /><br />
As soon as he comes back if you're 6 and he's 5, you can most of the time just all-in and force them to back a second time, even if it doesn't score the kill, the advantage you've given yourself at this point is incredible.<br />

Pre-6 ganks can be very effective with any Crowd control to allow you to guarantee Charm. Post-6 however can easily be ganked by any hero. Most of the time you don't even need a gank assuming your Ignite is up. Once you've landed a Charm/ Orb of Deception combo, you can use Spirit Rush to close the gap onto the enemy hero and Fox-Fire. You want to use Spirit Rush then to move into an advantageous position (typically between your opponent and wherever he wants to go). Make sure you don't Spirit Rush out of range of the hero so the damage portion still lands, use Ignite and they should die. There are really no heros who could live through this entire combo as long as you haven't missed an ability.<br /><br />
Once you're able to easily clear creep waves with a couple Doran's Rings and a few levels of Orb of Deception you're then able to roam. Once you push your lane you can look for ganks in either top or bot lane very easily. Moving to either lane and using your combo with or without ult can result in a lot of kills for either lane. Tower diving on bot lane with your ult is also very easy since you can use your ult to move in and out of tower range to drop tower aggro.<br />

Team fighting as Ahri is typically pretty simple. You want to land Charms on carries whenever possible, but landing a Charm/ Orb of Deception combo on anyone can be great initiation and often lead to a free pick-off followed by a 4v5 team fight in favor of your team.<br /><br />
On these types of pickoffs, it's important not to get over-anxious and blow your Spirit Rush into the hero if his team is behind him. At this point of the fight the enemy team typically hasn't blown any of their crowd control(CC) effects and one wrong Spirit Rush can result in a very quick death in a short amount of CC before you can even ult out again.<br /><br />
It's important to remember that while your ult does damage, it's not its only purpose. Spirit Rush's main purpose is mobility. Ahri demands so much attention, but once the focus is turned to you, you're able to Spirit Rush back out of range of the enemy team and they waste their time playing cat and... fox. Also when all of your cooldowns aren't up, a quick spirit rush out, then using the 3rd charge to move back in and use all of your cooldowns again can be extremely effective.<br /><br />
<h5>Main Goal in Team Fights</h5>
In the end, Ahri's main goal in team fights is to do large burst to high priority targets and land crowd control. Fox-Fire and Charm are extremely key for strong pick-offs, but Orb of Deception and Spirit Rush can be used for overall teamfight presence and don't necessarily need to be saved to try and hit high priority targets, since the true damage element of Orb of Deception does a lot of damage to even the tanks on their team.<br /><br />
The combination of massive damage and good control and kiting ability are what make Ahri such a huge asset in team play.<br />

Ahri is one of those champions that I know no matter how much time I spend writing this guide, I feel like I'll be leaving something out. Some intricate use of Spirit Rush or how to tell when you should be maxing Charm over Fox-Fire or any variety of random stuff.<br /><br />
I feel like I could go over warding and other stuff, but that should really be an entire guide in itself, and not just thrown in some random solo mid guide. So... this is it for now I guess! Basically, Ahri is an untouchable powerhouse. Between the ridiculous kiting potential of her ult, Charm, and her other abilities in conjunction with Rylai's Crystal Scepter, and her extremely high damage, Ahri can really be a staple for a lot of team comps.<br /><br />
I hope you enjoyed the guide, if you feel like I missed a big section or there's something I should add to make this guide just over the top awesome please let me know in comments below. As always, general criticism, praise, or feedback on anything in the guide is very much appreciated. Please +1 the guide if you found it helpful!<br /><br />
