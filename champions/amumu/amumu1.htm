<br /><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
Hello people, and welcome to my Amumu guide. Amumu is a really really great champion, and before you downvote it'd be nice if you would at least try my build's effectiveness in game. Amumu is a great initiator and my build makes him very durable. He is a potent ganker, an underestimated laner, and overall a very strong character, becoming both tanky and having a high damage output with few damage items. While many Amumu players like to jungle with him, I find that a little too slow for my tastes. It also uses a summoner spell slot up, and I really don't feel like I can afford that (At least with my personal playstyle).<br />

</table><br />
RED:<br />There's no question that it really is the best mark choice for this build<br />
YELLOW:<br />Seals are interchangeable. I find that Greater Seal of Armor are the best mainly for Amumu's ability to harass early game with Tantrum, although you may wish to use Greater Seal of Health or Greater Seal of Scaling Mana Regeneration.<br />
BLUE:<br />Concerning glyphs, I like to run Greater Glyph of Scaling Magic Resist. They outpace Greater Glyph of Magic Resist by level 10, which is when your game presence should really pick up and your magic resistance will most likely not measure up to your armor. We want a well-rounded tank all about and the extra MR will make a difference.<br />
BROWN:<br />Quintessences are also interchangeable. I prefer Greater Quintessence of Movement Speed because as their name implies they allow me to move quickly, allowing me to position myself late game for Bandage Toss and early games for Tantrum.<br /><br />

<img src="../../img/spells/flash.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/ghost.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">FLASH</span> + <span class="spell">GHOST</span><br />
I really enjoy running Flash and Ghost for those times when you get 5 man ganked. As Amumu it is entirely in the realm of possibility of escaping these ganks. You use your Curse of the Sad Mummy, Ghost if you need to get to a wall to Flash over, and run back home. This scenario has happened to me many times, and while most champions can fall flat on their faces, Amumu is not one of them.<br /><br />
You can get out of a ton of hairy situations [a real lifesaver!], as well as being able to position yourself for an easy Curse of the Sad Mummy initiation.<br /><br />

ALTERNATIVES<br />
<img src="../../img/spells/teleport.png" />&nbsp;<img src="../../img/spells/exhaust.png" /><br />
<span class="spell">TELEPORT</span><br />
Teleport is good on Amumu also. As Amumu, you are great at killing minions with your aoe damage, and Tantrum that will be spammed when you get hit by the minions. Great for pushing and for defending. Did I mention that Amumu is a great tower defender? Well, he is.<br />
<span class="spell">EXHAUST</span><br />
This summoner spell is great on tanks if simply for another CC to keep someone out of a fight [or reduce their damage a lot of they are super fed]. This is especially good in the laning phase or if you are unable to stop powerful channeled abilities.<br />

It'll also help us tons later when we get to the Rylai's Crystal Scepter..</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/sunfire-cape.png"></td><td class="left">Well there's no reason we shouldn't get this item. Sure, it blows our armor through the roof but since when was that a bad thing? The extra damage also adds a good amount of dps and synergizes well with our Despair. Not much more to say about that other then the good amount of health we get.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/rylais-crystal-scepter.png"></td><td class="left">Another item, this time the main stat we're getting is the health, although the ability power plays a very good part in why. Amumu's Despair does 2.7% health damage each second at it's maximum rank. It gains another 1% per second for every 150 ability power that Amumu has. When we take the 70 AP from our Abyssal Scepter and the 80 AP from this baby we get that extra 1% along with big tanking ability.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/frozen-heart.png"></td><td class="left">Honestly, this item will make our armor even higher and the biggest reason that we even take it is because it comes from our Glacial Shroud. But more CDR, armor, and mana is never a bad thing, is it? If you are facing a magic-heavy team however, it may be more beneficial to skip this item.<br /><br />
But you're probably still wondering "Hey, how could we skip that item? We have no slots left!" Well by now it is definitely in that late game stage where your Philosopher's Stone isn't doing anything more then giving you some extra gold. It's time to sell that baby to make room for...</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left"><img src="../../img/items/banshees-veil.png"></td><td class="left">A great item for a great champion. Your MR still doesn't measure up to your armor, and it'd be nice to have some more health wouldn't it? Well this is your answer for those long painful games. It's not really a necessity at all. But the more the better.</td></tr>

<br /><h3 id="early">Early game</h3>
In the laning phase your main goal should be to farm. If something is preventing you, then often using your Tantrum can be a good way to grab control of the lane when your enemies get close to you. Enemies with long range like Zilean or Caitlyn are a huge pain to lane against as Amumu and you should just focus on getting enough xp and gold for those Boots of Speed and Philosopher's Stone.<br />

<br /><h3 id="mid">Mid game</h3>
This is the teamfight stage (Or the pushing/ganking stage) and it is here where Amumu begins to shine. Using your ult to hold every champion in place that gets caught with it is basically overpowered as your team should be able to go wreck havoc on them. Use Despair when you are in the middle of things and Tantrum whenever it's up and enemies are in range. It makes a difference.<br />

<br /><h3 id="late">Late game</h3>
Your job is the same as it is in Mid Game. But you're just a lot better at doing it now. You're basically overpowered now. You should be able to 1v1 almost any champ if it's gone well and by the time they realize that they are losing a fight it's often too late since you have amazing chase ability with your Bandage Toss. While 1v1s won't happen often, it's important to realize that you need to maximize your damage output by staying in the middle of things, using your ult to destroy and allow your teammates to destroy everything around you and just be an amazing damage dealer and damage taker.<br />

To read about matchups and counterplaying, go to <a href="../../champions/against.html">Counter</a> and click on Amumu again :-)<br /><br />
I've been playing Amumu a while now, and he is one of my favorite tanks. This is obviously a sort of hybrid tank but it's a build that works. And remember, try it before you think about downvoting!<br />
